## What Can It Do? 🎭

This magical script can convert between:

* Storage:
  * Bytes (B)
  * Kilobytes (KB)
  * Megabytes (MB)
  * Gigabytes (GB)
  * Terabytes (TB)
  * Petabytes (PB)
* Distance:
  * Millimeters (MM)
  * Centimeters (CM)
  * Meters (M)
  * Kilometers (KM)
  * Inches (IN)

Whether you're dealing with the tiniest byte or a colossal petabyte, or measuring distances from millimeters to kilometers, we've got you covered!

## How to Use This Wizardry 🧙‍♂️

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlchafardet/unit-converter-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd unit-converter-python
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python unit-converter.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts:
   * Enter the value you want to convert
   * Enter the unit you're converting from
   * Enter the unit you're converting to

5. Voila! Watch in awe as your units are magically converted! ✨

## Example 🌟

```bash
Enter the value (go wild!): 1
Enter the source unit (B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, MM, CM, M, KM, IN) - we don't judge: IN
Enter the target unit (B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, MM, CM, M, KM, IN) - the sky's the limit: CM
Abracadabra! 1.0 IN is equal to 2.54 CM
```
