# 🚀 Storage Unit Converter Extraordinaire! 💾

Hello there, digital storage enthusiast! Welcome to the most exciting storage unit converter this side of the silicon valley! 🎉

## What's This All About? 🤔

Ever found yourself drowning in a sea of bytes, kilobytes, and gigabytes? Fear not! This Python script is here to rescue you from the depths of storage unit confusion. It's like having a universal translator for your hard drive!

## What Can It Do? 🎭

This magical script can convert between:

- Bytes (B)
- Kilobytes (KB)
- Megabytes (MB)
- Gigabytes (GB)
- Terabytes (TB)
- Petabytes (PB)

Whether you're dealing with the tiniest byte or a colossal petabyte, we've got you covered!

## How to Use This Wizardry 🧙‍♂️

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlchafardet/unit-converter-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd unit-converter-python
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python unit-converter.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the value you want to convert
   - Enter the unit you're converting from
   - Enter the unit you're converting to

5. Voila! Watch in awe as your units are magically converted! ✨

## Example 🌟

```bash
Enter the value (go wild!): 1
Enter the source unit (B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB) - we don't judge: GB
Enter the target unit (B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB) - the sky's the limit: MB
Abracadabra! 1.0 GB is equal to 1024.0 MB
```

## 🎉 What's New? (Changes)

### 🌟 Version 1.1: The "Pretty Print" Update 🖨️

Hold onto your SSDs, folks! We've just pushed an update that'll make your conversions look as slick as they calculate! Here's what's new:

- **Gorgeous Output**: Say goodbye to number soup! We've added thousand separators to make those big numbers easy on the eyes. 👀✨
- **Decimal Delight**: We've trimmed the fat on those trailing decimals. Now you'll see a tidy 2 decimal places. Precision meets beauty!

Before (Yawn 🥱):

```bash
Abracadabra! 1234567.89 MB is equal to 1.234567890 TB
```

After (Wow! 😍):

```bash
Abracadabra! 1,234,567.89 MB is equal to 1.23 TB
```

Why did we do this? Because we believe that even bytes deserve to look their best! 💅

So go ahead, give it a spin! Your converted units are ready for their glamour shot. Who said math can't be fabulous? 🎭🚀
