   ```

4. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the value you want to convert
   - Enter the unit you're converting from
   - Enter the unit you're converting to

5. Voila! Watch in awe as your units are magically converted! ✨

## Example 🌟

```bash
Enter the value (go wild!): 1
Enter the source unit (B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB) - we don't judge: GB

Abracadabra! 1.0 GB is equal to 1024.0 MB
```

## 🎉 What's New? (Changes)

### 🌟 Version 1.1: The "Pretty Print" Update 🖨️

Hold onto your SSDs, folks! We've just pushed an update that'll make your conversions look as slick as they calculate! Here's what's new:

- **Decimal Delight**: We've trimmed the fat on those trailing decimals. Now you'll see a tidy 2 decimal places. Precision meets beauty!

Before (Yawn 🥱):

```bash
Abracadabra! 1234567.89 MB is equal to 1.234567890 TB
```

After (Wow! 😍):

```bash
Abracadabra! 1,234,567.89 MB is equal to 1.23 TB
```

Why did we do this? Because we believe that even bytes deserve to look their best! 💅

So go ahead, give it a spin! Your converted units are ready for their glamour shot. Who said math can't be fabulous? 🎭🚀
